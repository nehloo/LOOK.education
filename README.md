# LOOK.education Visual LMS

LOOK.education started in 2013 as a free, basic application that allowed parents and teachers to curate, organize and distribute select public videos to their children and students, for education or safe entertainment purposes. Ever since, new features were added such as video-quizzes, 360-degree videos and VR viewers, custom AR experiences, and collaborative learning functionalities. Over time, the interest in such a visual education platform grew from K-12 schools and after-school programs, to workforce education, higher-ed, corporate training, and specialized education and training programs, with virtually infinite applications for media and visual assets management and distribution. From students, apprentices, trainees, to companies employees, organizations members, and even further to families, celebrities, astronauts (yes, LOOK.education was a NASA iTech semifinalist in 2017) and so on, LOOK.education could create visual excitement and could enhance the teaching and learning for a wide variety of people and organizations. Since 2013, the name of the platform evolved from YoouKids, to [JuniorTube](https://github.com/nehloo/juniortube) EDU, and then to LOOK.education.

LOOK.education became an open-source platform in 2019, starting with a new base code developed from scratch for what was then called "Next-Gen LOOK.education", and with the intent to attract a community of developers that would contribute to build an open-source Visual LMS. Learning and teaching visually may be the future of education and training, for all individuals regardless of their age, race, ethnicity, geographical location, disability status (including visually impared) etc.
